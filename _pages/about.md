I am a final year PhD student (since 2019) at the spAtial Sensing and Computing Lab ([ASC](https://asc.xmu.edu.cn/)) in [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Cheng Wang](http://www.cwang93.net/index_en.htm) and Prof. [Chenglu Wen](https://asc.xmu.edu.cn/t/wenchenglu). Before that, I obtained my B.E. (2016) and spent a two-year M.S. study (2017-2019) in Xiamen University. 
My research interests focus on 3D Computer Vision, including scene mapping, scene-aware 4D human motion capturing and Human-scene interaction reconstruction. 
My goal is to develop robust methods to perceive and understand human behavior in complex environments.

**In August 2024, I will be joining [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) as a post-doc, mainly collaborating with Prof. [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) and Prof. [Christian Holz](https://www.christianholz.net/).**

Feel free to reach out to me for discussions or collaborations.
