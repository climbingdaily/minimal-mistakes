I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), collaborating with Prof. [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) and Prof. [Christian Holz](https://www.christianholz.net/). I received my Ph.D. in 2024 from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) with Prof. [Cheng Wang](http://www.cwang93.net/index_en.htm) and Prof. [Chenglu Wen](https://asc.xmu.edu.cn/t/wenchenglu), in 2024. 
Before that, I completed my B.E. in 2016 and pursued a two-year master's study (2017-2019) at Xiamen University. 
My research interests lie in 3D Computer Vision, including scene mapping, scene-aware 4D human motion capturing, and Human-scene interaction reconstruction. 
My objective is to develop robust methods to perceive and understand human behavior in complex environments.
